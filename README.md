# house_market
House prices data analysis and visualisations 

## Aim
Using Pablo-tester account build some charts and analysis of the Housing market using R Git and GitHub

## Analysis plan

1. Load in data into R from xls files downloaded from ONS website
2. Conduct some exploratory analysis using line charts and scatter plots with simple models to assess relationships between variables
3. Test several univariate time series model
4. Automate the analysis using Targets to build a pipeline to produce a final report
5. Output a Quarto report highlighting the main findings in the house market data downloaded from ONS website.

All this analysis will be done in a dedicated R project using Git and GitHub for version control, adding new analytical features as new branches to main using my local repo as Pablo-tester. 


### Using trunk development to develop features

In this project I use trunk-based development to add features to the main branch. Pablo-tester GitHub account creates the features and  Pablo-source GitHub accounts reviews and approves the changes applied.


## 1. Exploratory data analysis 

### 1.1 Average house price change (%)

Year on year and month on month UK Average house price change are approaching negative rates in July 2023.
